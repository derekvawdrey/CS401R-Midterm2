# Action-based Snake Game

In a regular Snake game, the snake automatically moves every frame, whether you take an action or not. In this game, movement is action-based: the snake only moves when you perform an action. Each action triggers the next step of the game, instead of the snake moving continuously on its own.

## The Goal
Our goal is to train a Q-learning model that will play the game perfectly at the end of training.

## Running the code
...... TODO

## Solution
The solution is implemented in the ```trainer/solution_model.py```
